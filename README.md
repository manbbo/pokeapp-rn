# About the project

I decided to separate it into pages of 20 items, because it'd be lighter and smoother for the user to use. I also made it really simple so the user can scroll easily through them. I've put all in order (got their IDs) so you can also see their evolution and position.

In addition, when you click an Item, you're transported to the Pokémon Detailed page, where you can see their name in BOLD, its front photo, its types, and a scrollable list of attacks.

# Development setup

## What you needed to start

- Having An IDE (I recommend you using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), but anything serves as long as you can see and edit the code);
- Having [NPM (Node)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or [YARN](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) installed on your machine;
- Clonning it to your machine at C:/proj or another path of your choice;
- Running ``npm install`` on your CMD with ADMIN privileges to install the dependencies needed (you can enter the folder you cloned the project), ``npm install --global expo-cli`` to install EXPO, and then run ``cmd adm`` from the folder's path to instantly run CMD admin - if you're on Windows), and then ``expo run`` to run your application. It is going to open a local webpage, so you're able to run from using EXPO, and show info at CMD on how to connect your smartphone to run your app.
